# Most packages in the AUR need to be built, which requires tooling that is
# assumed to be the system version. I usually have different versions
# of those tools in my PATH (using pyenv, rustup, etc.), which causes the
# package build to fail. This tries to decontaminate the build environment by
# restoring some variables to their default system state.
