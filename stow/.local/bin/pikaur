# Wrapper for `pikaur` that ensures PATH overrides are cleared.

# Most packages in the AUR need to be built, which requires tooling that is
# assumed to be the system version. I usually have different versions
# of those tools in my PATH (using pyenv, rustup, etc.), which can cause the
# package build to fail.

# This tries to decontaminate the environment by restoring PATH to the default
# system state.
