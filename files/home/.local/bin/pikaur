# Wrapper for `pikaur` that ensures PATH overrides are cleared.

# Some packages in the AUR need to be built, which requires tooling that is
# assumed to be the system version. I usually have different versions of those
# tools in my PATH (using pyenv, rustup, etc.), which can cause the package
# build to fail, or, at least, not build repeatably.
